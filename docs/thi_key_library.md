# Thi key library

What is it does is creates the possibility to have more than two active abilities on your origin. 
With this library, you will be able to have up to 18 active powers on one origin.

## How do I use it?

1. The first step will be downloading the datapack off course. You will be putting the datapack in the following position: 
`.minecraft/saves/<name world>/datapacks/`. <br />
When you have placed it in your datapacks folder make sure the datapack is visible in-game. 
You will be able to check this with the following command: `/datapack list` <br />
If the pack is enabled it will be visible in the first list.

2. When you go in to the data map from the datapack. You will see three maps. <br />
If you want the library in your own pack you only have the copy the map named `thi_key_library`.
