# Thi key library

What is it does is creates the possibility to have more than two active abilities on your origin. 
With this library, you will be able to have up to 18 active powers on one origin. 
The powers will be set on a specific slot and key, for example, slot 0 and primary-key

## How do I use it?

**Step 1 - Downloading and placing in folder** <br />
The first step will be downloading the datapack off course. You will be putting the datapack in the following position: 
`.minecraft/saves/<name world>/datapacks/`. <br />
When you have placed it in your datapacks folder make sure the datapack is visible in-game. 
You will be able to check this with the following command: `/datapack list` <br />
If the pack is enabled it will be visible in the first list. <br />

**Step 2 - How you can use it with your pack** <br />
When you go into the data map from the datapack. You will see three maps in the data folder. <br />
If you want the library in your pack you only have the copy the map named `thi_key_library`. <br />
And the `key_layer.json` from the `data/origins/origin_layers/`. When you copy those you can use
them in your pack or you could use this datapack next to yours that would also work. <br />

**Step 3 - custom powers** <br />
