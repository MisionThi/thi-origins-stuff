# Welcome to the thi-origins documentation!

This page will hopefully be helpful when you're using one of my libraries, powers or origins in the future.

I will like to thank Minecraft that implemented the datapack feature in the game.
And of course Apace for creating the amazing origins mod and making it possible for us datapackers to make our own origins.

## What can you find here?
