## Powers

What is are powers you may ask yourself? 
A power is a component from the origins mod that you can link to the origin to make something happen.
Like becoming  invisible or moving items towards yourself. Some of the powers will require a bit more than one JSON file.
Since we also can use function files. This also why some powers will be in zip files since the power needs multiple files to function.

This feature is added by the [origins mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins).
