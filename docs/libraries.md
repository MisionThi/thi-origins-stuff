## Libraries

What is a library you may ask yourself? 
A library is collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks.
With this you will be able to implement more advanced concepts more easly or make repeating task less work.

The libraries are for the [origins mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins).
